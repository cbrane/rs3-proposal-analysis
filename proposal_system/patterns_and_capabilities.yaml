# These prompts were created for use with models like 4o, and 4o-mini, and are not made for models like o1-preview and o1-mini, as they use CoT prompting and other techniques that are made for models without 'reasoning' capabilities. If these were to be used today, they would be engineered to work well with o1-preview and o1-mini by being more concise, as these models can do much of the step-by-step reasoning themselves.
